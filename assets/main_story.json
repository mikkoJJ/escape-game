    "The cold dark year 20XX. \n\nJyv채skyl채, a city in the wild northern sector of the European Coalition, ruled by the iron fist of the Nordea-Kesko Conglomerate, is a ruinous mess. It has been left unattended by the Conglomerate's peacekeeping force for years, and is now a wretched hive of scum and villainy.\n\nConglomerate Head-of-Council, President Sauli IX Wahlroos-Berner, has declared marshall law on the area. Bandits and paramilitary mutant forces have teamed up to fight the battle drones build by The Kone Supergroup, an ally of the Conglomerate. The bandits are receiving help from the remains of the partisan fighters of Group S. The rebels are outnumbered, but equipped with dangerous technology and weapons procured from behind the Actual Iron Curtain. The Conglomerate fears a nuclear attack.\n\nHowever, recent events have given a dire turn on the situation. The carrier shuttle of President Sauli IX was returning home from a diplomatic mission to the United State-Colonies of Mars, but was intercepted by rebellious higher-atmosphere fighter ships. The shuttle was shot down, but the President is thankfully believed to be still alive. We have tracked his emergency beacon to the Jyv채skyl채 region, currently crawling with rebellious forces and ne'er-do-wells.\n\nYou, merc, have been given a Lipponen class higher-lower atmosphere interceptor ship. It has sufficient speed and manouverability to have a shot at breaching the enemy lines and locating the President before they do. This mission is near suicide, but the only way for you to avoid being executed for your Crimes Against Capitalism. You have 24 hours until the collar we installed cuts blood flow to your brain and you die. Good luck. You will need it.\n\n\nMission command out."
